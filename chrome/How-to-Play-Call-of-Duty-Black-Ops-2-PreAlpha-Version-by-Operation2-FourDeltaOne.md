The pre-alpha version of Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is a prototype build that was leaked online and contains some unfinished features and bugs. However, it also offers a glimpse into the development process of the game and some unique gameplay elements that were later changed or removed. For example, you can play on some maps that are not available in the final version, such as Prototype Warehouse[^1^], or use some weapons that were modified or scrapped, such as the XM8[^2^]. You can also play both multiplayer and zombies modes with other players online using the T6M client by Operation2 FourDeltaOne[^2^].
