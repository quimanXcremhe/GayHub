If you have bought or downloaded the game in a different language than English, you might want to install an English language pack to enjoy the game in your preferred language. In this article, we will show you how to do that in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download the English Language Pack
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the English language pack for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. You can find it on various websites, such as [this one\[^1^\]](https://jackiepugh.doodlekit.com/blog/entry/21383662/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-english-language-patch-download) or [this one\[^2^\]](https://www.shaymarshall.doodlekit.com/blog/entry/13335515/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-english-language-pack-download). The pack contains English audio and text files for the game. Make sure you download the correct version for your game (for example, patch 1.7).
 
## Step 2: Extract the Files
 
Once you have downloaded the English language pack, you need to extract the files from the archive. You can use any software that can handle ZIP or RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. Extract the files to a folder on your computer.
 
## Step 3: Copy the Files
 
Now you need to copy the extracted files to your game folder. To do that, you need to locate your game folder on your computer. It is usually located in C:\\Program Files\\Activision\\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Activision\\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare. If you have installed the game in a different location, you can find it by right-clicking on the game shortcut and choosing Properties.
 
Once you have found your game folder, open it and look for a subfolder called "zone". Inside this folder, there should be another subfolder with the name of your current language (for example, "rus" for Russian). Rename this subfolder to something else (for example, "rus\_old") so that you can restore it later if you want to switch back to your original language.
 
Then, copy the "zone" subfolder from the English language pack folder that you extracted earlier and paste it into your game folder. This will replace your current language files with English ones.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the Game
 
You are done! Now you can launch the game and enjoy it in English. You can change the subtitles and voiceover options in the game settings if you want. If you ever want to switch back to your original language, just delete the "zone" subfolder that you copied and rename the old one back to its original name.
